The difference here that the filmmaker actually followed up on his findings by not only contacting his namesakes but also traveling to whatever remote location called for to meet and interview the subjects of his search, even discovering (and verifying through genetic testing) a long-lost cousin. Jim Killeen the filmmaker in Los Angeles found, among others, Jim Killeen the priest in Cobh, Ireland, Jim Killeen the retired cop in New York, Jim Killeen the CEO in Melbourne, Australia and Jim Killeen the sexual swinger in Denver.

Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved.

Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies, coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day, however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors, people from the distant past. Petrified by fear, Sean told others of his experiences, but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn, not even his twin brother, he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha, his spiritual mother, does he discover his true calling, spiritual medium-ship. With change however, came resistance, from both his inner self and also the people around him. We explore how after first being frightened of ridicule, he now uses his gift to help others. Reflecting the complexity of medium-ship and spirituality as a religion, academic experts and grassroots activists explain this shift in beliefs and tell us what they are exactly. They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland, Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution.

What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama ""autobiography,"" offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voiceover actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Barack Obama sold himself to America as the multi-cultural ideal, a man who stood above politics. Was the goat herding Kenyan father only a fairly tale to obscure a Marxist agenda, irreconcilable with American values? This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of Davis and Obama himself. Dreams of My Real Father weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for ""fundamentally transforming America?"" Director Joel Gilbert concludes, ""To understand Obama's plans for America, the question is not 'Where's the Birth Certificate?,' the question is 'Who is the real father?'"""

40025, Art in our Time: Toward a New Museum of Modern Art (2002) , documentary ," The Museum of Modern Art in New York was founded in 1929 by three inspired society women who wanted to make contemporary art accessible to the public. They had the good fortune to find a brilliant collaborator, Alfred Barr, as their chief curator and director. At the time contemporary art was not as intensely collected as it is today, while Barr had an eye for exceptional work. So began a most remarkable collection, which is unsurpassed to this day. The program dwells on the riches of this collection, which was presented with a fresh point of view, as the museum's 'end of the century' cycle of exhibitions titled 'MoMA 2000'. Instead of MoMA's famous traditional installation of the collection in chronological order, oriented heavily towards the ' School of Paris ', the curators assembled works by themes which offered the public a new approach to the understanding of the art of our time. One aspect of this different approach was to experiment with finding new ways for MoMA to connect more decisively with the art of the present, as the term 'modern' can be construed as the art of the first half of the last century. A substantial part of this effort is also the museum's reorganization in a much expanded building designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, which was completed in 2004. Since then MoMA has been in the process of finding the best way to present itself and the collection in the new space ART IN OUR TIME: Toward a new MoMA gives a sense of the museum's attempts at finding a new direction for itself, with emphasis on its astounding collection. It is presented to the camera by the curators of the three cycles of the 'end of the century' exhibitions. The video also looks back to the beginnings of the institution and the cast of characters of those early days."
45912," ""Det okända"" (2004) ", documentary ," People from all over Sweden write in to ""Det Okända"" when they feel that they have been visited by spirits from beyond the veil. Sometimes they are frightened, sometimes they are convinced it's a loved one visiting them, but what they all have in common is that they want to find out what the spirits want. A team of mediums are on standby to help the families - but they are told nothing about what the family has experienced. Instead, they must attempt to connect to the spirits and gain their information that way. The mediums tell the family and the cameras what impressions they are getting, and what type of connection they are making. They also try to get as many details about the person they are in contact with as possible, and try to find out what the spirits are doing in the house. Sometimes the family will recognize the spirits, and sometimes the spirits are connected to the house or the area rather than the family. Sometimes the mediums connect with a spirit that has been unable to cross over to the other side, and have to help them over or ""cleanse"" the home. Sometimes just finding out what the spirit wants makes the phenomena stop. After the medium has completed his or her work, the TV-team compiles the information about the spirits and tries to find out more about them. In the cases when the families have recognized a relative or friend, this is relatively easy, but with older, lingering spirits or ones that are connected to the area, there is a fair bit of research done as the team try to find proof that all the people the medium had contact with really existed. Sometimes it is impossible to verify, sometimes it becomes obvious who the mediums where in contact with. ""Det Okända"" works with some of Sweden's foremost mediums, and prides itself on the fact that unlike many shows about mediums they never ""cheat"". There is no research done in advance, and the mediums aren't given any information in advance, not even an address. It is also entirely unscripted."

She begins within her own church and asks that all women from all churches are brought together. At one meeting, a Muslim woman goes up to the podium to address the church and tells them that she is moved by what they were doing and that Muslim women need to be brought into the Peace Movement. This was a cause that transcended all differences. With this extraordinary mission, the women dressed in plain white clothes and covered their heads, as a way to shed any differences of class or religion among them. They decide to make peace signs and sit in at the fish market where the Liberian president drove past every morning. He refuses to acknowledge them for weeks.

The UN peacekeepers move in and the Liberian president is exiled to Nigeria. The women understood that they could not rely on anyone else to make sure that the resolutions are implemented. They also realize, seeing the UN only creating chaos, that to ensure full disarmament in the country, they would need to step in, forgive their perpetrators, and convince each one of them that they would be accepted back into the community.

18291, Confession (1999) , drama ," ""Confession"" is a 4-channel film. Fictitious and semi-abstract, this project is built on real and imaginary action - a young girl applying herself to the toughest layers of history she read or heard about. She is reminiscent of Alice in tragic Wonderland or of Shakespearean Ophelia with her longing for simplicity. Blurry monologue of the video is not meant to be spelled out, but rather states a very private nature of her ""confession"" without guilt. The focus of it is a young girl placing herself in different historical and geographical environments, traveling in her mind through different mise-en-scenes. She seems to meditate in the face of nature about life and death, faith and disbelief. She dives into the imaginary world of her own, in the world of memories inherited from stories told by her grandparents. Confession as a subject of study is necessary for humans to understand themselves. If confession does not serve to discover truth, it will, at the least, teach her fundamental rules of life. For the artist, there is a possibility of studying a pure event, no longer manipulated or interpreted by the historical subjectivity. Any superficial interpretation of habitual confession would drain the girl's visions. She turns to the beauty of the past, rediscovers that ""history survives its disappearance"" (Jean Baudrillard)."

9288, Language (2018) , drama ," Weaving in elements from Dante's Divine Comedy, the members of the court begin to move up and down the tower based on the morality of their actions. As the characters betray each other, they move lower and lower to the darker levels of the tower, and as Lear's madness progresses, his kingdom descends into hatred and his authority crumbles. The society he helped create, and the mentalities he helped foster, are dissolving into hatred, conflict and the destruction of the tower itself. The film's underlying idea illustrates that failure to be inclusive and genuinely behave towards one another with respect, civility and kindness will result in the breakdown of the social order, regardless of the language in which we express ourselves. When we started working on this project, we realized the stark lack of diversity in the film industry. This new adaption of King Lear will not only showcase Canadian talent but, as each character will speak a different language, also reflect the unity of Canada's diverse communities and explore the concept of language as a socio-political currency."

36849, Pennhurst (2008) , documentary ," Pennhurst is a documentary film chronicling the stories of many people whose lives are irrevocably intertwined with the history of the Pennhurst State School and Hospital, located outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Once a massive institutional home for the developmentally disabled, Pennhurst exemplified the divisive method of institutionalized care that rose to popularity early in the 20th Century as a result of the Eugenics Movement. Though the facility closed in 1987, its haunting past is a reminder of a place and time that gave birth to a civil rights movement all its own. The Eastern Pennsylvania State School for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic was established in 1908 in order to segregate those deemed ""mentally defective"" and ""feeble minded"" from society. The facility, originally built for a resident population of 1,300, was later renamed ""Pennhurst State School and Hospital."" The grounds included 17 buildings, among them a farm, stables, a piggery, all interconnected by a labyrinth of underground tunnels, allowing Pennhurst to function completely self-sufficiently. During the course of its first fifty years, Pennhurst's record was marked by a number of scandals involving mistreatment of patients, violence, drug abuse, embezzlement, and neglect by staff. After requests for an investigation into inner workings of the institution by the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) in 1968, a young reporter named Bill Baldini brought cameras into Pennhurst for the televised investigative report ""Suffer The Little Children."" The five-part report was the first time that the conditions inside Pennhurst had ever been exposed to the public. What the world saw in Baldini's report was a cramped, filthy, prison where the mentally handicapped were left to rot, in many cases strapped to their beds, with no hope of rehabilitation. Those higher-functioning individuals who had the misfortune of being grouped with the severely disabled had seen their condition decline, lessening their chances of successfully re-entering society. In 1974, a class action lawsuit was filed, one which was to become a landmark case in the civil rights movement for people with mental retardation. On December 23rd, 1977, a groundbreaking decision was announced, stating that for the first time people with mental retardation have a right to live in the community. This decision led to a mass exodus of residents, many of who were moved into local community living arrangements with support staff. It became the catalyst for the nation-wide deinstitutionalization movement. Over the last few decades Pennhurst has been at the center of much of the legislation that has arisen to guarantee rights and respect for those members of our society whose needs demand our attention and caring. As you will see, many individuals associated with Pennhurst have become leaders on the national front to proliferate understanding, acceptance, and tolerance for all disabled people of our nation. Their efforts culminated in 1990 with the signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act, although the struggle for them and their loved ones is far from over. After Pennhurst officially closed its doors in 1987, the fallout for its former residents and employees was mixed. Some patients were able to make the successful transition to life back in the community; others met with great difficulty on the road to independence, and still others found no viable alternative to institutionalized living. In many cases these individuals had been dumped, literally left at the doorstep of Pennhurst, with no family or home to return to. Despite its evils, Pennhurst was all that many of them had. Today, the former residents of Pennhurst, their families, and the former employees of the institution have moved on from the place that connects their pasts, but the polarizing legacy of that site that once linked them lingers in all of their lives. To some, Pennhurst was a loving home, a refuge from a life of extreme hardship and ostracization. To others it was a house of horrors, a place where society conveniently hid away its 'undesirables' and turned a blind eye to the cruelties and injustices that ensued. Accusations of abuse and neglect were once common on the grounds of the institution, and by reopening the gates of this secretive, secluded world the film sheds light on wrongs committed against those who were unable to tell their story on their own. This film delves beneath the surface of the now defunct Pennhurst State School and Hospital to investigate the personal tales of the people whose memories of Pennhurst range from the nostalgic to the nightmarish. It is a journey into the lives of a group of people who were long without a voice, but whose story is finally being told."

29480, It for Others (2013) , documentary ," With 'It for Others', Irish artist Duncan Campbell has created an impressive study of the web of ideas that we enshroud things, art, consumption, life and death with - nothing less. Combining essayistic combination of gorgeous archive footage, animation and a new performance by Michael Clark Company, his latest work elaborates on Chris Marker and Alain Resnais's essay film 'Les statues meurent aussi' (1953), where the Western exoticisation of African art is presented in an elegantly questioning meditation about how we see objects and movements, and endow them with meaning - be it a wooden African sculpture, a packet of cigarettes, the touch of a hand or the exchange of consumer goods. 'It for Others' refers both formally and discursively to a great number of modernistic art movements and theories, but brings them up to date with a twist, which simultaneously undermines the coolly aloof analysis that we are first presented with, and subsequently anchors it in real situations - namely the civil war in 1970s Ireland and a contemporary Chinese sweatshop, where Che Guevara t-shirts are produced on the assembly line."

37626, River of Fundament (2014) , drama ," In 2007, Matthew Barney and Jonathan Bepler began a new collaborative project inspired by American author Norman Mailer's 1983 novel Ancient Evenings, set in pharaonic Egypt. The project was conceived as a nontraditional opera with a series of one-time-only live acts performed across the American landscape. The film River of Fundament combines documentation of these three live acts with scenes set in a reconstruction of Norman Mailer's brownstone apartment in Brooklyn Heights. Barney and Bepler's script reimagines Mailer as his own protagonist who reincarnates three times in three different bodies by magically entering the womb of his wife Hathfertiti. With each incarnation the undead Norman emerges from a river of feces that runs beneath his Brooklyn Heights apartment and enters his own wake. Imagined as a memorial gathering attended by figures in the New York literary world, the wake takes place inside the Mailer apartment as it is ferried down the river. Guests eulogize Mailer and offer condolences to his widow. As the evening wears on, the wake gives way to a scene of carousing and revelry, in which characters from Ancient Evenings play out their incestuous struggles for power and their insatiable appetite for pleasure as the music gains momentum. Each incarnation of Norman joins the wake for a time, haunting the guests and challenging the ancient undead figures of gods and demigods. He endures two rebirths but fails to be reborn a third time, thus ending his attempt to ascend to a higher, more powerful state. The powerful pharaoh Usermare evokes the spirit of Ernest Hemingway and engages Norman's three incarnations in a struggle for dominance. In a parallel narrative, River of Fundament replaces the body of Norman with the body of an automobile in the American landscape. The automobiles' story begins with REN, a live performance staged at a car dealership in south Los Angeles. A 1967 Chrysler Crown Imperial undergoes its first death and is prepared for rebirth as a 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. The second performance, KHU, unfolds along the River Rouge and Detroit River. KHU brings the Chrysler back to its birthplace Detroit, where it is dismembered and melted in five monumental furnaces. BA, the final live act, takes place at locations along New York City's East River, culminating in a battle at a dry dock in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. At the conclusion of BA, the automobile is further transformed into the 2001 Ford Crown Victoria."

52661, The Power of Place (2015) , documentary ," The Power of Place explores the places, issues, and people affected by Northern Pass, a proposed 180-mile long electricity transmission line project in New Hampshire that will carry electricity from Quebec to southern New England. In this 50-minute film, New Hampshire-based conservation photographer and author Jerry Monkman interviews people throughout the state to explain opposition to Northern Pass. Jerry also spent months in the field applying his signature landscape photography style to filming the places in the path of the project, including the Appalachian Trail and the White Mountain National Forest. Electricity giant Hydro-Quebec needs to sell more of its electricity to New England, and Eversource Energy wants to pitch in by distributing this power to customers in southern New England. To do that the companies have joined forces to build Northern Pass, a 187-mile transmission line that will bisect the state of New Hampshire with high-voltage cable strung between 1500 steel towers rising as tall as 135 feet. Residents of the ""Live Free or Die"" state have a problem with that. New Hampshire is a place where people's connections to the land run deep. Its mountains and forest, lakes and rivers, are part working landscape and part outdoor playground, and those opposed to Northern Pass see it as a desecration of this landscape. The Power of Place tells a compelling story by exploring the issues surrounding Northern Pass - its promise of bringing jobs and cheaper electricity to New England; the fears of those living next to the potential power line corridor; and the visual impact of the towers on iconic New Hampshire landscapes like the White Mountain National Forest, The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and the state's Great North Woods Region."

Instead, he and Banty distract the townspeople by playing three songs (Maynard fiddlin' and Rice on the harmonica) while Wolf and his gang are up the street looting the town.

21422, Daisy Bates: First Lady of Little Rock (2010) , documentary ," Daisy Bates: First Lady of Little Rock is the story of a seven-year journey by filmmaker Sharon La Cruise to unravel the life of a forgotten civil rights activist named Daisy Bates. Beautiful, glamorous and articulate, Bates was fearless in her quest for justice, stepping into the spotlight to bring national attention to issues - and some say herself. Unconventional and egotistical, she became a household name in 1957 when she fought for the right of nine black students to attend the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her public support culminated in a constitutional crisis - pitting a president against a governor and a community against itself. As head of the Arkansas NAACP and protector of the nine students, Bates would achieve instant fame as the drama played out on national television and in newspapers around the world. But that fame would prove fleeting and Bates would pay a hefty price for her attempts to remain relevant. The film travels with Daisy Bates on her long and lonely walk from orphaned child to newspaperwoman to national Civil Rights figure to her last days in Little Rock. Bates's journey, full of triumphs and defeats, parallels the ongoing struggle of generations of African Americans who have challenged America to live up to what it claims to be for more than 200 years. Produced and directed by La Cruise, Daisy Bates: First Lady of Little Rock premieres on the Emmy Award-winning PBS series Independent Lens on Thursday, February 2, 2012 at 10 PM (check local listings)."

And its economy has grown at an annual rate often double that of China's turbo-charged national average of 7-8 percent. Once a gray, oppressive Communist metropolis, Shanghai is now - as a Time magazine cover story recently proclaimed - ""The Hippest City in Asia"" For the last five years, the Canadian photographer, Greg Girard, has been working on a project that represents his attempt to document these incredible changes. Every night at twilight, Girard heads out with his large format camera to document the old houses, apartments and residential lanes that have been disappearing as a result of Shanghai's relentless growth. What Girard's project is concerned with is not just the disappearance of the historic buildings that were erected before the Communists came to power in 1949. But the disappearance of a singular, Shanghainese way of life. ""I'm documenting the people who live beneath the bright lights, the shadow of the city"" says Girard, a soft-spoken Canadian who has worked in Asia for the last 25 years. ""The people who are being left behind and yet whose lives are being affected the most."" Today, Shanghai exists in a window between two worlds; a new city is rising as the old Shanghai disappears. In the film, we follow Girard as he photographs the end of one Shanghai - and the beginning of another. We will take viewers into a Shanghai that outsiders never see. Into the old Art Deco and Art Nouveaux villas, houses and apartments designed by the British and the French in the early 1900s where the majority of Shanghainese have lived since 1949. It is a world of cramped living quarters, shared kitchens and common stairwells. A world that became even more over-crowded when hundreds of thousands of workers and their families were forcibly moved into these old buildings during China's Cultural Revolution. It is this world that is, in many ways, the soul of Shanghai. The only life the residents of this city knew for the half-century between Shanghai's liberation by the Communists and its ascension to its current position as China's most modern metropolis. To have grown up and lived in these old, densely populated houses built by foreigners is, for many, the essence of being Shanghainese. Whereas other Chinese cities were ancient villages that became towns that became cities under Communist urban planning, Shanghai was a fully realized foreign city that was effectively taken over by its Chinese inhabitants. It is this foreign-built environment that gives Shanghai its unique character. And in the old lanes and alleyways of the former French and International Concessions, Shanghai exists much as it has for the last 50 years. Neighbors gossips with neighbors they have known for decades, the elderly sit outside their tiny apartments playing mahjong and children help their mothers with laundry at the outdoor sinks or do other after-school chores. It is an urban existence unlike any other. One shaped not only by colonialism, Communism and the tumult of China's Cultural Revolution - but also by an urban landscape unlike any other in all of China. Yet as skyscrapers continue to rise above these old lanes and the city continues its untrammeled march toward its singular brand of hyper-modernity, it is a Shanghai that is disappearing by the day. The film will follow Girard on a journey from the old disappearing Shanghai to the new Shanghai that emerging in its place. Articulate, intellectual and passionate about the project that has been his obsession for the last five years, Girard will serve as both the film's subject and its narrator. Though the film's structure is that of a traditional documentary - with distinct sequences where Girard interviews the different characters as he goes about photographing them for his project - the script will take the form of an essay. As we see Girard at work, interacting with the characters, his voiceover will explain why does what he does. Why photographing these old houses and the Chinese who inhabit them - these people ""who live beneath the bright lights"" - is more than just an attempt to document the end of one era and the beginning of another. It is a search for a city's soul. And through that search how he hopes to understand not only where Shanghai has come from, but also where its future will take it. This documentary follows photographer Greg Girard as he records every night at twilight the old houses, apartments and residential lanes that have been disappearing. What Girard's project is concerned with is not just the destruction of the historic buildings, but the disappearance of a singular, Shanghainese way of life."

26124, Deutsche Pop Zustände (2015) , documentary ," A documentary film about the interplay between pop culture and extreme right ideology, which reflects the development of nationalist music since the late 1970s in Germany. For decades, popular culture was considered modern and emancipatory but in reality it has long been part of the center of society and it has noticeably opened itself up to the right-wing. The transition from the mainstream to neo-Nazi ideology has become apparent. Music played a central role to NSU (National Socialist Underground)-terrorists Uwe Bönhard, Uwe Mundlos and Beate Zschäpe, who were politicized within the subculture of the neo-Nazi scene and often attended its concerts. The extreme right-wing music scene, especially the network ""Blood & Honour"", were supporters of the NSU-terrorists. The scene increasingly builds on the mobilizing effect of the music; an idea that the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) made its own in 2004 when it sought ""the hearts of young people to be conquered through music"" by way of the so-called NPD-Schoolyard CDs that were distributed in German schools. To date, these CDs describe very precisely the actual ideological state of right-wing music. The documentary by Dietmar Post and Lucía Palacios characterizes these developments and gradually establishes connections to the socio-political developments in Germany from the late '70s to today. Similar to its pop-historical documentary ""Monks - The Transatlantic Feedback"", which in 2009 was awarded the Adolf Grimme Prize (German TV-Oscars), the authors also work in this film without a narrator by using instead intensive conversations and meticulously researched archive material, establishing a dialogue between pop theorists, sociologists, musicians, label owners and protagonists of the right-wing scene."

EVERYTHING STRANGE AND NEW is an intimate portrait of ordinary people and their longing for certainty in uncertain times. Wayne is a carpenter, no longer young but uneasy with the emotional complexities of adulthood. Aimless hours spent with Leo, his newly-divorced drinking buddy, offer some relief to the heavy gravity at home, where his kids run roughshod over his increasingly unstable wife. Living between these worlds leaves Wayne feeling like a character in someone else's story. Ultimately, a violent spasm rouses him from this fevered American dream.

29932, The Year of the Beaver (1985) , documentary ," A documentary based on the 1976 strike at the Grunwick photographic processing plant in London. The strike of the workforce of mainly Asian women lasted two years with widespread support from the rank and file union membership including post office workers refusing to handle Grunwick mail. Using contemporary interviews with workers and media coverage the film examines this special phase of history that set the stage for Thatcherism and neo-liberalism and marked the end of the post-war consensus in the UK and elsewhere. The most noteworthy thing about this film is that so much of it is devoted to what workers actually did and what workers have to say. There are no interviews with union leaders, politicians or industrial relations experts. This makes a refreshing change from many documentaries. It takes the Grunwick strike as an example that clearly shows the interplay of the media, the police, the union leadership, and the political machinery to usher in a new phase of modern capitalism. The Grunwick story contains issues of: the use of machinery in the intensification of work; the lack of support and blatant sabotage of the struggle by the union leadership; the 'staged media event' and the messages conveyed and myths created by the media; the heavy policing used to break the picket lines; the issues of race, migration and gender in the workplace and in the workers' movement; the blacklisting of militant workers and the political changes leading to Thatcherism."

29374, Resolved (2007) , documentary ," The fascinating complexity of high school debate gives way to a portrait of the equally complex racial and class bias of American education in Greg Whiteley's riveting documentary. Initially a portrait of top-flight debaters from well-funded, mostly white schools-like nationally ranked Sam Iola and Matt Andrews of Highland Park, Texas-the film deepens when it changes focus to Richard Funches and Louis Blackwell from Long Beach's Jordan squad. While gifted traditional debaters in their own right, the two decide to challenge the usefulness of the jargon-filled, 400-word-per-minute style of modern debate (known as ""the spread"") by steering their debates toward issues of personal experience and dialogue. What is the use of refining an argument, they stress, when it does not affect the reality of a person's locale and particular life? Why must individual perspective and bias be masked? For many, these questions present such a radical interpretive shift that competitors and judges crumble in front of them. Contrasting Fuches and Blackwell's attempt to challenge the system with Andrews' relentless pursuit to excel in it and win the prestigious Tournament of Champions, Whiteley deftly explores the disparities between the debaters, their styles, and their resources. Alternately inspiring and polarizing, Resolved reveals a constantly shifting sport that is as much philosophy as competition. - Travis Miles (Los Angeles Film Festival)"

4092, Ich kenn keinen - Allein unter Heteros (2003) , documentary ," A controversial documentary about four gay men, who are living on the countryside of Swabia (a rural area in the south west of Germany) far off big cities. Being alone as Gays among a entirely heterosexual environment, they still try to live a rich and happy life. In big cities discrimination against homosexuality and gay way of life is not a big issue anymore. Gay mayors and football club association presidents are no longer colorful exceptions to the rule, rather they have become an expression of normality. In rural areas, however, the definition of what is normal is quite different. Out here, normal means a husband, wife and children ""the nuclear family"". In the country, expressions such as ""proofter"" are still common parlance and mothers are ashamed if their sons fail to bring home a girlfriend. Hartmut, Richard, Stefan and Uwe are all gay men who live in the country. They punctuate their rural existence with brief but regular sojourns in Berlin, Zürich or Thailand. These four men have learned to live with the fact, that their lifestyle is met with a volley of abuse from their heterosexual friends and acquaintances in the church choir and at the local pub. Jochen Hick's film provides an insight into a largely unknown world. The audience follows the lives of the protagonists via the comments of their heterosexual environment. Expressed in the local dialect, the often comical and regular surprising comments on homosexuality demonstrate just how deep the gulf is between what is supposedly normal and what comprises a deviation from the norm. The film provides a bitterly comical portrait of a heterosexual perspective on gay men in Germany's country towns."

44158, Joan Crawford: Always the Star (1996) , documentary ," This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964."

Her Majesty's secret service is called in and Sam McCready asks Desmond Hannah of Scotland Yard to take charge of the case. When Hannah arrives on Sunshine, he notices the subdued atmosphere of fear reigning there. An aggressive presidential election campaign is being conducted, but neither of the two candidates appears to be very trustworthy. The attractive widow Lady Beatrix Coltrane tells Hannah that most of the island's inhabitants are not looking forward to independence because they fear that either of the two candidates for the presidency will abuse the island for his own benefit. One of them, Tomson, is probably involved in illegal drug-peddling in connection with the Colombian Medellin cartel; the other one, Livingstone, is said to be collaborating with the Cuban government. Lady Beatrix' representations are confirmed by Reverend Drake, the island's priest, whom Hannah also discovers to be a strict opponent of independence. Ernie Favaro, a policeman from Miami, arrives on Sunshine. He is investigating the murder of one of his colleagues by members of the Medellin cartel. A hot trail has brought him to the island. The two cases could be connected, and Hannah and Favaro agree to collaborate. But as they have no official permission to carry on their investigations, they are in constant danger of being arrested by the local chief constable, himself suspected of corrupt behaviour. Shortly after the two policemen called on Tomson, one of the candidates for the presidency, somebody tries to kill them. But they are able to intercept and arrest the gunner. To their surprise, he is none other than Reverend Drake. He claims to have missed the target on purpose, intending to draw the attention of the international press to the precarious political situation on the island. After the arrest of Reverend Drake, the chief constable at last has a pretext for apprehending Hannah and Favaro for illegal possession of firearms. But suddenly, to everybody's surprise, Sam McCready arrives on the scene and identifies himself as the interim governor of the island. He takes charge of the case himself. Lady Beatrix makes certain insinuations which lead Hannah to conjecture that she is the perpetrator of the governor's death. Her motive, like Drake's, appears to have been to draw inter-national attention to Sunshine. But Hannah has no proof for his theory. Meanwhile, Ernie Favaro believes to have found a hot scent in the case of his murdered colleague.

42150, The Quarrel (1991) , drama ," Montreal 1948. On Rosh Hashanah, Chaim (a Yiddish writer) is forced to think of his religion when he's asked to be the tenth in a minyan. As he sits in the park, he suddenly sees an old friend whom he hasn't seen since they quarrelled when they were yeshiva students together. Hersh, a rabbi, survived Auschwitz and his faith was strengthened by his ordeal, while Chaim escaped the Nazis, but had lost his faith long before. The two walk together, reminisce, and argue passionately about themselves, their actions, their lives, their religion, their old quarrel, and their friendship. Rosh Hashana 1948. Chaim Kovler and Hersh Rasseyner were childhood friends in Bialystok, Poland, but have not seen each other in years when they were both twenty. Then, they became estranged for an argument they had on the issue of Judaism, specifically about leaving the yeshiva. Since, Chaim has become a Yiddish writer who has turned his back on the faith. Hersh has become an orthodox rabbi. By chance, they run into each other in a park in Montréal, where Hersh now lives and where New York based Chaim is visiting on a speaking engagement. Each believed the other had perished in the Holocaust. Initially, the two men forgive each other for the quarrel that has estranged them for all these years. But as they spend the better part of the afternoon together walking through the park and talking about their lives, they find that their individual views of Judaism have only strengthened over time, in large part because of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of their respective families, including Chaim's wife. The question becomes whether their chance reunion will reunite them or tear them further apart emotionally. If there is one word to describe this movie it is ""guilt."" The guilt of surviving the holocaust while all others perished, the guilt of leaving family members or friends in limbo expecting the sun always to rise tomorrow, and the guilt of loving a g-d that turned his back on his most ardent followers in their time of need. Chaim and the Rabbi, are two childhood friends haunted by both their past experiences and decisions, or are they? The Rabbi not only feels the guilt of losing his friendship with his best friend Chaim, but when his father apologized for his treatment not accepting that apology. Chaim, while he feels bad about the loss of his friendship with the Rabbi, lives with the guilt of not being there for his family in their time of need. Deep down and side he feels guilty for his actions by hiding his cigarette and helping with the minyan. But in the end, Chaim continues to rejects the lifestyle required of an orthodox Jew and walks off into the sunset. In summary, not only this is a relative debate for those that survived the holocaust resulting in those that grew closer to g-d and those further away but is a movie of unique qualities. It reminded me of the old movies with Humphrey Bogart and other greats with the intense drama between two characters and where no one else existed."

Researchers have learned a great deal about how this curious creature could make such a phenomenal voyage. Some of the most valuable information was gained from a single voyage. Scientist Wallace J. Nichols released the captive loggerhead turtle, Adelita, into the Pacific a decade ago. Over the course of a year, Adelita did what no sea turtle had ever done before, she took researchers and turtle enthusiasts along on her journey, to her beach, to nest. Since then, researchers have shed much light on how sea turtles like loggerheads navigate the astounding trip. One of the more fascinating aspects of this navigation is the turtle's use of magnetic mapping to chart its course."

The services are the same, non-existent."" It's not pretty but it's revelatory. ZERO TOLERANCE - Rape as a weapon of war has had much press, most notably in the recent Congo wars. Less discussed is the legacy it has left behind; a desensitized acceptance of the abuse of women at the hands of criminals, opportunists and most worryingly, ordinary men. Hamadi's short documentary film aims to get right to heart of the matter by following the arrest of a group of youths who attack a women returning from the shops. Hamadi's focus is a rural community, where political correctness holds no sway, and in so doing he attempts to show both the depth of the problem and the attempts by authorities to reset the national moral code.

19384, Ashpet: An American Cinderella (1990) , drama ," &lt;p&gt;Recommended by the National Education Association, this folksy, Americanized retelling of Cinderella spins a more realistic yarn, void of princes and fairy godmothers. The place: a woodsy, sweltering Southern town; the time: pre-World War II. Picture two rude stepsisters, their ambivalent mother, and a sweet teenager nicknamed Ashpet (in the original German story, her name was Aschenputtel, ""Cinder Maid""). True to the original Brothers Grimm tale, this kindhearted lackey obeys every demand. Foremost, the stepsisters order Ashpet to fetch love sachets from ""Dark Sally,"" an intimidating conjure woman, so they can attract mates at the town Victory dance--a soirée honoring the local boys who are headed off to war (and a rare event in this modest town). Not a problem: Dark Sally adores Ashpet and intends to make her the belle of the ball. Rather than whipping out a magic wand, Dark Sally encourages Ashpet to bathe in a remote pond and don a knockout dress (once her mother's) hidden in a secret room of the house. The rest of the tale, missing slipper included, runs much as expected. But its subtle humor, smart dialogue and creative setting make Ashpet play like a tall, icy glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade on the senses; it's a refreshing, 45-minute substitute for other, rather syrupy Cinderella stories. --Liane Thomas &lt;b&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Winner of many awards including Kids First Award, Parents Choice Award, American Library Association's ""Selected Films for Young Adults,"" American Library Association's ""Notable Films for Children,"" Best Short Subject at the Philadelphia International Film Festival, Best Children's Entertainment Film at the American Film Festival"

He is also in control of the Boyd Chemical Company, another large corporation with the same greedy and heartless policy which turns out upon the public certain harmful and toxic medicines, among which is Saco-Ozone, a widely advertised cure for tuberculosis and pulmonary diseases. Back of the powerful arm of Emerson Boyd is David Duncan, general manager of the Boyd Mills. Duncan is also a crooked politician. He is in love with Eleanor, Boyd's daughter, who, however, is secretly engaged to Matthew Brand, one of the idle rich. Emerson Boyd reads a newspaper attack upon the Boyd Corporation and, in a great rage, calls Duncan to see what influence he can use as a political boss to muzzle the paper. Eleanor goes away and Brand runs across the newspaper article against her father. Alarmed by the facts set forth in the paper, Brand determines to investigate, and, calling upon Cole, the editor of the ""Clarion,"" hears a story that makes him sick at heart. Then he learns that Boyd's political machine has muzzled the paper. Brand pays a visit to Boyd's factories, and is horrified at the unsanitary conditions. Brand visits the ""Clarion"" office and buys the paper, but retains Cole to help him. They start at once on an article that drives Boyd wild with rage when the paper comes from the press. Brand goes to call on Eleanor. At the same time Duncan and the detective are closeted with Boyd. While Brand is telling Eleanor of his campaign with the Tuberculosis Society to wipe out the dread disease the detective is telling Boyd that the man who is so bitterly opposing him and printing the vitriolic stories is none other than the quiet Matthew Brand, who has been courting his daughter. Boyd is astounded. Meanwhile, Eleanor has become so enthusiastic that she determines that her father must hear the story and hurries to the library, where Boyd is closeted with his hirelings, and begs him to come and listen to Matthew Brand. When Brand sees Boyd, the latter attacks him unsparingly and, refusing to grant him a hearing, orders him to leave the house and never return. Eleanor is astounded. The National Tuberculosis Society meets with failure, for, when Boyd learns of the proposed sanitarium, he orders the mayor to prevent it, fearing that it might hurt his patent medicine business. Following the dictates of his superior, Mayor Alrich replies that the finances of the town would not warrant such a measure. Meanwhile Boyd becomes interested in the persistent attack upon the horrible system of the great mills and inquires of Duncan as to the truth of the stories. The latter lies glibly. In the meantime, Eleanor has gone to the ""Clarion'' office to see her sweetheart. Duncan calls, and Brand pushes Eleanor into an adjoining room, that she may hear what is said. Duncan threatens Brand to induce him to stop the damaging articles, but Brand defies him. Boyd is beginning to admire Brand, but Duncan plans to dynamite the ""Clarion."" Eleanor, becoming very ill, the old family physician is sent for, and, making a thorough examination, tells Boyd the crushing news that his daughter has symptoms of tuberculosis. Duncan arrives at the rendezvous where he learns that the police have become suspicious of the gangsters and they had retired to await his orders. Duncan is angered to the utmost over the hitch in the well-laid plans, and, calling them all the utmost cowards, takes the bomb himself and bids them follow. In the darkness of the rear of the ""Clarion"" office, Duncan sets the bomb and lights it, while on the inside, Brand and a helper are working over some copy. The bomb has a defective fuse, and a premature explosion takes place, killing Duncan, while the falling bricks and masonry seriously injure Brand. Boyd's family physician tells the money king that there are no places in Every-town for the proper treatment of tuberculosis, as Boyd and other corporation owners have persistently fought to keep out all sanitariums. Boyd thinks of his own remedy, and sends for a case of Saco-Ozone. He reads from the testimonials of its wonderful cures, but the family physician appears, and hurls it all from the window, telling him that it is harmful and poisonous. He then tells Boyd that Eleanor, to get well, must be sent to an open air sanitarium. When Boyd tells Eleanor of the doctor's suggestion, and offers her anything her heart desires, if she will only try to get well, he is told that her one wish is that he will send for Brand and listen to him. Boyd leads Brand to the library, where he listens to the other's talk on the existing evil conditions and of his efforts to prevent the spreading of tuberculosis. Boyd thereupon plans to reconstruct Every-town. Miracle upon miracle is accomplished by the enthusiastic money king, who sends his daughter to a sanitarium, where she ultimately recovers after receiving good care, fresh air, rest and wholesome food.

Meant for anyone and everyone who ever felt like they couldn't be labeled as just one thing. People say, that this era and music was for all the misfits, but no person is just one thing, we are all mixed bags, and Alternative music allowed us to be whoever we were, and united us in all our differences."

Serving as presenter and guide is the charismatic Slavoj Zizek, acclaimed philosopher and psychoanalyst. With his engaging and passionate approach to thinking, Zizek delves into the hidden language of cinema, uncovering what movies can tell us about ourselves. Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch, or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock, Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion, intellect, and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from 'within' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest,' director Sophie Fiennes' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas. Says Zizek: 'My big obsession is to make things clear. I can really explain a line of thought if I can somehow illustrate it in a scene from a film. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA is really about what psychoanalysis can tell us about cinema.'"

22288, Who's Driving the Dreambus? (2009) , documentary ," Life is full of big questions: Who am I? Why am I here? Why is there suffering? Is there life after death? and - ultimately - the question we all try to find the answer to, How can I find happiness or peace of mind? But what if that search for happiness was based on a huge misconception, a misconception that has been drummed into us since birth, that we are separate individuals? In Who's Driving the Dreambus? filmmakers Boris and Claire Jänsch go on a personal journey through a series of interviews with eminent spiritual teachers, philosophers and writers - in a quest to unravel what it means to be alive. This radical and challenging documentary, ventures into the heart of the mystery of identity, flipping the idea of spiritual endeavour on its head, revealing a message so profound and yet so simple that it might just end the search. Narrated by Boris Jänsch, the film opens with extraordinary footage from his actual birth filmed by his father, and it becomes clear early on that Boris' search for answers has until now been somewhat unfulfilled. This poetic and uncompromising film comes full circle as it examines birth, death and asks the big questions. No spiritual stone is left unturned as the interviews also tackle wide-ranging topics including suffering, choice and free will, enlightenment and meaning. At times uncomfortably honest but equally humorous Who's driving the Dreambus? is unlike any film in its genre to date and delivers a message with a radically non-dualistic flavour. If you have a treasured belief system, whether it's based on religion, agnosticism or indeed atheism, then this film may be a hard pill to swallow - because what this film is pointing to is the end of individuality. You may have been searching for answers your whole life but are you ready to acknowledge that there might not be any? As Tony Parsons puts it: 'Oneness creates the idea of being a separate individual and goes around looking for something called not being a separate individual... it's a joke, it's the biggest joke in town'."

She is one of only two Africans to have won the Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize, the other being Nelson Mandela. Having suffered great economic and social privations under Mugabe, Beatrice hopes for a better future for Zimbabwe.

From Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project who was detained for 89 days, for investigating human rights abuses, ""I thought I had moved out of my body and I was watching this suffering woman from somewhere else. That's what the pain did to me"". To Roy Bennett, an exiled political activist and White farmer. ""If it wasn't for Beatrice, I'm sure they would have killed me in that prison."" The Mugabe regime is aware of her fight and seeks to slander her at every turn. ""I can tell you Beatrice Mtetwa is not a stickler for the law, she uses the law to push her political agenda."" Jonathan Moyo from the Zanu PF party tells us. In fact the vitriol is so intense that after clearing Beatrice's client, foreign journalist Andrew Meldrum, the judge launched an extraordinary personal attack on her: ""He read his verdict which was an hour long. It was 59 minutes of guilty... and half of the verdict was a character assassination of Beatrice."" Here is an inspiring story that breeds hope for Zimbabwe and yet Beatrice remains inspiringly modest: ""This has to be done. Somebody's got to do it, and why shouldn't it be you?"""

803, Arctic Window (1985) , documentary ," Filmed in the heart of Chicago, across the uninhabited Icelandic interior, and on the sea cliffs of volcanic Heimaey Island, the program provides a window to two lands and its people; one urban and American, the other, wild, wondrous, and inhabited by modern-day descendants of ancient Vikings, and to a delightful little bird that most of us would never get a chance to see. The film begins by tracking the expedition of the project's lead zoologist across the entire length of Iceland, taking in an amazing landscape of waterfalls, glaciers, hot springs and geysers and spending a day with a rural Icelandic family living on the country's north coast, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. He then travels by ship to the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, located off of Iceland's south coast. Here, the zoologist is joined by a handful of colleagues, who set to work on the steep coastal bluffs to humanely capture and crate for air transport to the U.S. several dozen newly-born, downy puffins. The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape. Finally, the film records the puffins' arrival, veterinary examinations, and climatic entry into their new home that, for nearly 4 million zoo visitors per year -- and on a busy day, more than 200 busloads of city school children -- will provide a ""window to a world"" they've only heard of or read about in textbooks."

Squeaky-voiced detective Michael Brick and his employer Carmine do locate Gateano at the Ritz, as does his wife Vivian. Slightly rotund Gaetano Proclo of Cleveland, Ohio long ago married Vivian Vespucci of the New York mob-tied Vespuccis, the marriage which has never sat well with Vivian's father, the controlling patriarch of the family.

As Carmine and Michael have never met, Michael believes that Gaetano, using Carmine's name, is his boss rather than the man he is supposed to find.

15606, Behind Forgotten Eyes (2007) , documentary ," Nuremberg. The trials of Nazi war criminals in the aftermath of the Second World War are well known around the world as an example of justice delivered. Yet there were other unspeakable crimes stemming from that war, and for their victims, justice has been denied. Germany has reckoned with her wartime past. When, if ever, will Japan do the same? Behind Forgotten Eyes presents the stories of a few brave women who came forward and broke the silence protecting a past that some want to stay buried. What are these stories that were hidden for so long? Whilst Korea groaned under the harsh colonial rule of Imperial Japan, the Japanese military coerced, tricked, and forced the women of Korea into a brutal and systematic form of sexual slavery on an unimaginable scale. During colonial Japan's wars, the Japanese military procured more than 200,000 Korean girls and women to serve as sexual slaves. Forbidden to leave the rickety shacks hastily constructed near the front lines of Imperial Japan's aggressive wars, often with a blanket as the room's only ""furniture"", they were forced to have sex with some 30-40 men every day. To this day, the Japanese government has yet to formally apologize or pay compensation to these women. This film touches not only on the past but also the vital lesson that history must not be allowed to repeat itself. Behind Forgotten Eyes examines the enduring legacy of this horrifying chapter of history in both Korea and Japan. As the first English-language film to tackle this volatile issue, Behind Forgotten Eyes aims to focus the world's attention on this unsettled aspect of Japan's colonial heritage and to educate an American public unfamiliar with East Asian history and modern society. Behind Forgotten Eyes combines first-hand accounts from both Korean women and Japanese soldiers who lived through the nightmare with the expert testimony of academics, social activists, and professionals from Japan, Korea, and the United States to offer a candid look into an issue that has been ignored for far too long. Time is running out for these women and their stories."

Will the Indian policewomen succeed in ensuring that the voting takes place in a safe and trouble-free environment?

14194, 6ft Hick: Notes from the Underground (2010) , documentary ," A behind-the-scenes music documentary that reveals the messy, all-too human face of the low-budget music scene in stark contrast to the perceived glamour of an internationally touring rock band. Raised on a chicken farm in rural Nambour, on Australia's northeast coast, front men Geoff and Ben Corbett sought their artistic beginnings in the 80s, dabbling in punk and performance art. They milked their North Queensland roots relentlessly for its inbred, bigoted imagery, filtered through wicked wit and self-deprecation. Touring for 15 years, the band has become an underground institution. One reviewer described their show as ""an indistinguishable pulverising barrage of screams, sweat, spit and blood flowing over a fierce, raw pulsing din."" Their shows engender an atmosphere of trance and possession as the duo lurch around the stage, barrel into the crowd, hang upside-down from lighting rigs, drink beer from boots, eat the contents of ashtrays, and blood let. Their mild-mannered alter egos spend every waking moment maintaining day jobs and living normal lives, and amassing resources until they may re-awaken that beast. This documentary takes stock of the 6ft Hick machinery: what motivates and drives them in a world where music is about cashing in or bowing out? Offstage, these same figures are humble, considered and witty, offering candid insight into what they've created."

Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.

However, in a world where anything could change instantly by the sight of a knife or a gun, little Chiron rejected by his crack addict mother, he is doomed to live a predestined life, caught in a tragic and vicious cycle where Juan, the only man who really cared about him and a paternal figure is a dealer, and Paula, his junkie and neglectful mother, is Juan's best customer.

The City of London is the famous square mile in the middle, with about 7,000 residents but many more businesses. A Corporation older than Parliament, the City of London has played a key historical role in protecting and promoting the interests of finance capital.

The film exposes the Corporation's anti-democratic constitution, the ancient laws which allow it function as a state within a state, and thus to promote an illusory promise of economic growth at the cost of the real economy.

Participants include Lord Glasman, John McDonnell MP, the Revs. William Taylor (Stamford Hill) and Alan Green (Bethnal Green), Natalie Bennett, Malcolm Matson, Occupy activists, and Professors Doreen Massey, Robin Blackburn, Steven Haseler and Clive Bloom.

51744, Bandits of El Dorado (1949) , western ," Wanted outlaws have mysteriously disappeared. Ranger Captain Henley and Steve have a plan to find them. Steve becomes a wanted man by faking the killing of Henley. Not only is he now in trouble as both the Rangers and the Mexican Rurales are after him, but Smiley knows him and may expose his masquerade to the bad guys. The tell-tale signs that one of the films in Columbia's ""Durango Kid"" series is going to be comprised of about thirty minutes of stock footage from one of the earlier films are; 1) there is no actress credited, 2) it opens with a droning narrative and 3) the opening scene cuts right to the stock footage. All three apply here, but once past the opening scene that has Edmund Cobb, Ray Bennett, John Merton and Kermit Maynard robbing a bank in footage from ""Galloping Thunder"" (and Maynard reappears a few scenes later as a stage guard in the new footage), this ""Durango"" entry quickly becomes a film that looks unlike any other in the series reference design, style, plot, acting, camera placements and movement and other little attributes that sets a film aside, and all this done by, for the most part, the exact same people on the crew side that made all of the other films in the series. Go figure. The plot is nothing new in that the Texas Rangers and Mexican Rurales can find no trace of six to seven wanted outlaws on either side of the border. Texas Ranger Captain Henley and Ranger Steve Carson stage a fake killing of the Captain by Carson in order to make him a wanted fugitive, and find the answer to the mystery as such. Carson comes to Copper City with the information that the owner of the town mercantile, B.F. Morgan, can provide a refuge for those on the dodge from the law. He can since he is really in the employ of the leading citizen, Charles Bruton of both Copper Town, Texas and El Dorado, Mexico who, for a fee, guarantees the outlaws he hides that they won't ""ever"" be found. And stands behind his guarantee. But the outlaws don't trust Carson too much, and he is caught between the outlaws and the Rangers, led by Tim Starling. Mahoney also keeps busy as Starrett's double for both the Carson and Durango roles, and literally chases himself down alleys, up staircases and across roof tops. A nice touch for trivia lovers occurs when Mahoney (doubling the Carson character) jumps from a rooftop onto a passing horseman and the two men who doubled for Starrett in over 90% of his westerns from 1935 onward, find themselves on the back of the same horse."

19274, Le dernier des injustes (2013) , documentary ," A place: Theresienstadt. A unique place of propaganda which Adolf Eichmann called the ""model ghetto"", designed to mislead the world and Jewish people regarding its real nature, to be the last step before the gas chamber. A man: Benjamin Murmelstein, last president of the Theresienstadt Jewish Council, a fallen hero condemned to exile, who was forced to negotiate day after day from 1938 until the end of the war with Eichmann, to whose trial Murmelstein wasn't even called to testify. Even though he was without a doubt the one who knew the Nazi executioner best. More than twenty-five years after Shoah, Claude Lanzmann's new film reveals a little-known yet fundamental aspect of the Holocaust, and sheds light on the origins of the ""Final Solution"" like never before. 1975. In Rome, Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last President of the Jewish Council in the Theresienstadtghetto in Czechoslovakia, the only ""Elder of the Jews""* not to have been killed during the war. A rabbi in Vienna, following the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, Murmelstein fought bitterly with Adolf Eichmann, week after week for seven years, managing to help around 121,000 Jews leave the country, and preventing the liquidation of the ghetto. 2012. Claude Lanzmann, at 87 - without masking anything of the passage of time on men, but showing the incredible permanence of the locations involved - exhumes these interviews shot in Rome, returning to Theresienstadt, the town ""given to the Jews by Hitler"", a so-called model ghetto, but a ghetto of deceit chosen by Adolf Eichmann to dupe the world. We discover the extraordinary personality of Benjamin Murmelstein: a man blessed with a dazzling intelligence and a true courage, which, along with an unrivaled memory, makes him a wonderfully wry, sardonic and authentic storyteller. Through these three periods, from Nisko in Poland to Theresienstadt, and from Vienna to Rome, the film provides an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Final Solution. It reveals the true face of Eichmann, and exposes without artifice the savage contradictions of the Jewish Councils. *according to Nazi terminology"

But luck is against them both and the game ends badly - real life reduced to radio drama. David Staebler, who suffers from chronic depression, is a Philadelphia-based late night radio host, his program on which he waxes philosophically about his less than satisfying life. Many of those stories revolve around his relationship with his two year older brother, Jason Staebler, who is always out for the big score, and living with their grandfather. After not hearing from Jason in one and a half years, David receives what is an urgent telephone call from him, Jason who wants David to act as the intermediary with one of Jason's associates, Lewis, to bail him out of jail in Atlantic City, where he is charged with a felony. Although David doesn't speak directly to Lewis as Jason had instructed, Lewis does bail him out of jail. David learns that Jason is living in Atlantic City, running one of Lewis' third rate resort hotels. Jason lives in the hotel in one of the small suites with his girlfriend, Sally, an aging and fading ex-beauty queen who clings to that past as her sole identity. Also living with them is Sally's younger longtime companion Jessica, to who Sally tries to pass along her beauty queen identity. Sally and Jessica's relationship is more than meets the eye. For as long as David stays in Atlantic City, Jessica is his implied companion. Using his connections through Lewis, Jason says that he is working on a developing his own resort casino in Hawaii, and wants David to come along with him, Sally and Jessica. Deep in his heart, David knows that Hawaii is just another of Jason's pipe dreams, just like all the other times he has made such proclamations. Regardless, David stays in Atlantic City for the two brothers to reconnect. However, this life cannot last forever, based partly on the several house of cards on which Jason is living, one of which is destined to crumble around him."

The conference included discussions, collaborative writing sessions, and visits to museums, shrines, and cultural sites and culminated in a collaborative BOOK of ghazals (a poetic form employed by Rumi), prose reflections, and translations composed by participants as a homage to the spirit of international exchange. Participants met with Esin Celebi Bayru, Rumi's great granddaughter (21 generations removed), visited the Rumi Shrine and the shrine of his mentor, Shams e Tabris in Konya, and traveled to the southern town of Karaman to explore a village where Rumi once lived with his family.

Attenborough's film lays out seven components of a sane response to global warming - strategies and targets from the household to big industries and government.

Our goal is to debate these strategies in a positive and constructive spirit: combating the paralysis of swirling fears with concrete ideas for informed action."" But in retrospective, in 2006, Attenborough did not have enough scientific evidence to be more blunt. So, the author of this review simply summarizes the situation of year 2011 as following: Pollution, eating species into extinction and massacre of environment happens on global scale: sacred and very needed by life on Earth trees are being massacred by human predator. Gold mining, illegal tree cutting, illegal ranching in Amazon already destroyed a lot of sacred trees. Films: ""AMAZON with Bruce Perry"", ""The End of the Line (2009)"". Most vicious predator (human) must learn to stop destroying its own environment.

47131, Blessings: The Tsoknyi Nangchen Nuns of Tibet (2009) , documentary ," In Tibet, the word for woman translates as ""lower rebirth."" In a remote eastern region of the country, the Tsoknyi Nangchen nuns defy this definition. Devoted to the ancient practices of Tibetan Buddhism - once primarily a male domain - over 3,000 nuns have attained elevated status. Director Victress Hitchcock honors them in this moving documentary, which follows the journey of a small group of Western women to remote mountain hermitages to meet these nuns. Buddhist teacher and spiritual leader Tsoknyi Rinpoche III leads the group, imparts his knowledge, and bridges the gap between cultures. Narrated by Richard Gere, Blessings explains the Tibetan Buddhist monastic system and the changing role of women within it, incorporating historic black-and-white footage from the 1960s Cultural Revolution of the People's Republic of China, when all forty Nangchen nunneries were destroyed. Many of the nuns were imprisoned in work camps; others scattered back to their nomadic families. A few survivors hid in caves until, years later, they surfaced to rebuild the nunneries, stone by stone. Elders who kept the yogic tradition alive now teach it to young women. Hitchcock interviews both the nuns and the women who come so far, physically and spiritually, to meet them. The former, some fresh from a three-year retreat, explain why they chose their path; the latter speak candidly of the trip's profound impact upon them, as egos and twenty-first-century concerns fall away. Inspirational as it is, though, Blessings doesn't lack a lighter side. In one memorable scene, the nuns chant and play their music for their guests, who respond in kind by dancing to the tune of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."""

19622, Stories We Tell (2012) , documentary ," In this inspired, genre-twisting new film, OscarŽ-nominated writer/director Sarah Polley discovers that the truth depends on who's telling it. Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story. Actress/director/writer 'Sarah Polley (I)' (qv) conducts a series of interviews - ""interrogations"" as one of her interview subjects calls them - with family, friends and acquaintances. She wants her subjects to talk openly and honestly of their perspective of the ""issue"" that sparked this documentary, which starts off seemingly about the marriage of Sarah's parents, actors 'Michael Polley' (qv) and the long deceased 'Diane Polley' (qv). Sarah's four siblings and her father talk about the issue as a long held family joke that started casually when Sarah was thirteen. Michael also provides a self-written monologue about the issue. That issue ultimately comes to light as the documentary progresses, and which affects Sarah and Michael the most among the living family members. But as that issue does come to light, the question becomes whether the movie is or should be about the issue itself, or if it should be about the perception of interviewees through the stories they tell about the issue. Much will depend on how Sarah ultimately wants to frame the movie through her editing process."

Weymouth's popularity as a seaside resort was enhanced dramatically from 1789 onwards, when King George III frequently visited to bathe in the gentle waters of the bay. You will also re-live the history of Osmington's famous White Horse, the Roman Villa at Preston and the airfield that once stood on the nature reserve at Lodmoor. Weymouth suffered greatly in World War II, as devastating air raids destroyed much of the Chapelhay district, yet the town went on to play a key role in the path to final victory. In 1944 many thousands of American troops embarked from the harbour for the D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches."

For six years Moon TV showed us that also television can be an alternative and independent media outlet. Youth, music and lifestyle channel Moon TV burnt with a flamboyant flame from 1997 to 2003. Starting as an humble chat and text message -based local channel, it became in the end a nationwide, respectable, cable channel. Moon TV was the youth's rebellion against the old ways of making television. In the tale of Moon TV there is truly all kinds of stories. The channel was known mostly for it's extravagant ways: it's often totally drunk channel VJ:s , it's porn film reviews, it's in-your-face attitude. Everything was covered that happened to interest the personnel: programs of punk, techno, heavy metal music, about big machines, different types of alcohols, computer games etc. One of the most celebrated program types were the ""documentations"" of different music festivals, mostly consisting of very drunk VJ:s interviewing very drunk festival goers. Although the channel was known for it's crazy antics, at the same time it was very street-wise. Nearly all of the personnel were under 25 years old and the VJ:s really know about their subjects, many of them deeply immersed into the scene which they were covering. In the end the venture company behind Moon TV got fed up with the heavily money-loosing channel. As the very marginal channel didn't get enough viewers, it was pressured to change it direction to please the greater audience. This was already to late as the channel had been hemorrhaging money from the beginning. So to the utter shock of the workers, the channel was shut down in the summer of 2003"

30273, The Last Word (2008/IV) , documentary ," This documentary takes the ""Innocent Man on Texas Death Row"" tale to a dark corner feared by all - - proving that an innocent man has been executed by the State. A clash between good and evil strikes up on the High Plains of Texas when Johnny Frank Garrett, a 17 year old retarded boy is arrested, convicted and ultimately executed for the Halloween night rape, mutilation and murder of Sister Tadea Benz. The 76 year old nun was attacked while she slept in her room at the St. Francis Convent in Amarillo, Texas. Garrett claimed his innocence from the time of his arrest until his dying breath. Sixteen years after Garrett's execution new evidence rose up from the cold case grave of the Amarillo Police Department proving they executed the wrong man! During interviews with key players the case of Johnny Frank Garrett unfolds like a recipe for executing the innocent. A death penalty obsessed District Attorney and his lap-dog medical examiner, ladder climbing cops, bloodthirsty media, enraged and fearful jurors, incompetent defense lawyers, politicized judges, witch hunting religious zealots and an iron fisted Governor with national ambitions meld together as perfect ingredients for a plate of government sponsored murder. In Garrett's final statement he professed his innocence one last time but did so in a voice driven by hate and vengeance. In his chilling conclusion Garrett promised those responsible for his murder that someday he would have the last word and they would pay for what they had done. For most of Garrett's enemies ""someday"" happened long ago. Regardless of faith, for or against the death penalty, liberal or conservative The Last Word compels viewers to feel not only the collective pain our societal conscience suffers for executing the innocent but also the individual fear or not knowing what margins of error our judges, jurors and executioners will find acceptable tomorrow."

(2012) , documentary ," In Canada, when we think of ""temporary workers,"" the image that comes to mind are the seasonal agricultural workers who have working in our fields for the past 40 years, or the live-in nannies and maids from the Philippines. But these days, temporary foreign workers are found in all sectors: fast food, service stations, city bus drivers in Calgary, and even line workers on the CBC telecommunication towers in Montreal. Canada, a country with a reputation as a ""land of immigrants,"" appears to taking its cue from places like Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia, places that run on temporary foreign workers. The one-hour TV documentary, The end of immigration?, uncovers a trend which is having a major impact on the type of country in which we live, one that relies increasingly on -- ""rent-a-workers"" -- rather than immigrants, a process that could spell ""the end of immigration"" as we know it. Today, the number of temporary workers arriving each year in Canada far exceeds the number of immigrants. By comparing the situation of these temporary workers with that of their own parents who arrived in Canada as unskilled workers in the last century, the filmmakers uncover a hidden world that's as close as the MacDonald's on the corner. And they ask the crucial question: is this the kind of society we want to build?"
